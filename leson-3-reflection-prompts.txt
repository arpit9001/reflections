When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever multiple person are working on a project , so that they can commit independently
from their machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is because it might  be possible that the logic piece of code or functionality might not
be completed before git pull the changes automaticcally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks : to clone repositories on Github servers.
clones: to clone repositories within local machine or from github to local machine.
branches : When to add a new feature or test some new functionality or fix something ao that it doesn't affect your current work.
