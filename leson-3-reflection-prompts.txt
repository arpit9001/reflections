When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever multiple person are working on a project , so that they can commit independently
from their machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is because it might  be possible that the logic piece of code or functionality might not
be completed before git pull the changes automaticcally.
